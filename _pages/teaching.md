## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in fostering an interactive and engaging learning environment where students are encouraged to think critically and apply theoretical concepts to practical problems. My teaching approach emphasizes:

- **Hands-on Learning:** Incorporating practical examples and projects
- **Critical Thinking:** Encouraging students to question and analyze concepts
- **Real-world Applications:** Connecting theory to industry practices
- **Student Engagement:** Creating opportunities for discussion and collaboration
